# Errors and Fixes
### Errors Found

#### According to ESLint, the following errors were detected:

    Error 1 (app.component.ts, line 16, column 6): 'X' is never reassigned. Use 'const' instead.
    Error 2 (user-list.component.ts, line 17, column 10): Unexpected any. Which requires 'Specify a different type'.

### Fixing Problems Manually
#### Error 1: Using const for X

To resolve this error, the variable X was initialized using the const keyword, indicating that its value would not be changed throughout its scope.

#### Error 2: Defining an Interface for User

To address the second error, an interface named User was created to define the expected properties of a user object: name and age. This interface was then applied to the Users array in both the user-list.component.ts and the user.service to ensure that the objects within the array adhere to the specified structure.

#### Code Example (user-list.component.ts):
#### TypeScript

interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

// ...

export class UserListComponent implements OnInit {
  users: User[] = []; // Using the User interface

  // ...
}

##### Code Example (user.service.ts):
##### TypeScript

interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

// ...

addUser(user: User) { // Using the User interface for the parameter
  // ...
}



#### By making these changes, the code becomes more type-safe and maintainable, as the compiler can now enforce the expected structure of user objects.
